		        <p>I went to a frat party last Saturday hoping to meet my <em>prince Charming</em>. I mean there's 50 boys living in one house, how hard could this be?</p> 
		        <figure><img src="img/prince.jpg" alt="prince" style="width:304px;height:228px;"></figure>

		        <p>As I expected, <i>frat bros</i> are the most romantic boys in the word! I was immediately swept off my feet when one asked me if I wanted to take a Burnetts handle pull. </p>
                <figure><img src="img/frat.jpg" alt="frat" style="width:304px;height:228px;"></figure>
		
		        <p>From the kindness of his heart, he even gave me the option of Strawberry Banana, Tropical Fruit, and Pink Lemonade. It was so sweet; <em>I took a pull of them all.</em></p>
				<figure><img src=img/burnetts.jpg alt="burnetts"></figure>

		        <p>Just the fact that he could afford 3 bottles of the <b>finest and most luxurious</b> vodka made me begin to think of the life this man could show me. I had to know his name. I asked and the answer <strong>made me melt</strong>- <mark>"Chad."</mark></p>
                <figure><img src="img/isabella.jpg" alt="hearteyes" style="width:304px;height:228px;"></figure>
		
				<p>But that's when I saw Todd. He was wearing nothing but a <i>furry speedo, cowboy hat, with cowboy boots</i> swinging around a <i>12 inch gold magic wand</i>. That's when I remembered the last time I wanted to buy a 12 inch magic wand. They cost $2000 each. Todd was def richer.</p>
                 <figure><img src="img/cowboy.jpg" alt="cowboy" style="width:304px;height:228px;"></figure>
				<figure><img src=img/wand.png alt="wand"></figure>
		        
		        <p> At that moment I knew I wanted Todd. I went up to him and he told me he got it from Diddy. </p>
                <figure><img src="img/diddy.jpg" alt="diddy" style="width:304px;height:228px;"></figure>

		        <p>Unsure if it was just me or all the burnetts going to my head, but the whole room turned into a set of a 2000's rap and hip hop music video. It was pretty hot. </p>
                <figure><img src="img/50drive.gif" alt="video" style="width:304px;height:228px;"></figure>
		
		        <p>I kept my eyes on Todd and his 12 inch funstick from the table I was twerking upon. Then 50 Cent approached and offered me a tab of "ratchet acid"- his own proprietary formula. I just couldn't say no. </p>
                <figure><img src="img/50smile.gif" alt="50cent" style="width:304px;height:228px;"></figure>
		        <figure> <img src=img/fiddy.gif alt="50 cent"></figure>
		        
		        <p>But THAT's when I saw Dick with a <em>ham and cheese sandwich</em>. I ran towards him and snatched the sandwich out of his hand, quickly eating it all before he could react</p>
                <figure><img src="img/ham.jpg" alt="ham" style="width:304px;height:228px;"></figure>
		
		        <p>The only thing that was missing was the <mark>spicy ranch.</mark></p>
                <figure><img src="img/spicyranch.png" alt="spicy ranch" style="width:304px;height:228px;"></figure>
   
		        <p>That's when I slid to the kitchen to raid the fridge. The only thing in there was half a bottle of jager, <i>a rotten banana</i>, some expired milk, and a tub of ice cream with a screwdriver in it. I said forget this and eyed the room for souvenirs to steal.</p>
                <figure><img src="img/fridge.jpg" alt="fridge" style="width:304px;height:228px;"></figure>
		
		        <p> Todd walked in with <strong>Flava Fla</strong> by his side. I knew only one thing could make this moment perfect. And there it was, in Flav's beautiful arms- a gallon of  spicy ranch. And just in the nick of time <small>(according to his clock)</small>, the acid kicked in. </p>

		        <figure><img src="img/flav.jpg" alt="flav" style="width:304px;height:228px;"></figure>
		        
		        <p>The next morning I woke up covered in spicy ranch with Flava Flav doing my dishes and 50 Cent vacuuming my floor. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/slayed/"><b>I #slayed.</b></a></p>

		        <p> ...and that kids, is how I met your father.</p>
